Wave Two:

In this wave, we will design the framework of our Backbone application. Then, using this framework we create for ourselves, we will begin by implementing the front-end of our Tic-Tac-Toe game using Backbone Views.

Scope

We will not be completing the entire implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in this wave. These are the requirements for what you should complete in this wave:

Complete the design (on paper, whiteboard and/or Trello) for all components in your Backbone game implementation
Create "stub" files and folders for all of these components in your application
Design the user interface for your Tic-Tac-Toe game (on paper, whiteboard and/or Trello)
Implement the user interface for your game in your application, using templates, "regular" HTML and CSS
Implement the framework for handling the DOM Events that your front-end will interact with. Note: By "framework" here, we mean determine what those DOM Events are and creating function "stubs" that will handle the actions that correspond with these events in the next wave.
Note: Don't start on the JS object to Model conversion until Wave three!

Testing Requirements

No additional requirements for this wave
